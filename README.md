# Satellite-Image-Classification
## About
The project is to learn about various convolutional neural network architectures and to analyze and compare their relative performances on multi-class classification problem on dataset.Source for dataset - 
`Satellite image Classification Dataset-RSI-CB256​`.\\
The following convolutional neural network architectures have been implemented
1. LeNet
2. AlexNet
The following Convolutional neural networks have been implemented using transfer learning / pre-trained models
1. VGG
2. ResNet50
3. DenseNet

## Conclusions
It was observed that pre-trained models performed best in terms of overall accuracy indicating their effectiveness in feature extraction and classification.​ Dropout regularization didn't help much with the accuracy with any of the architectures , indicating absence of overfitting in these models.
